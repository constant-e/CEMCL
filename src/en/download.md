## Release
### v0.1.0
**Warning**: This is a alpha release. Only features not requiring network connection are implemented. And all the features haven't been fully tested.

The features:

1. Launch Minecraft (including forge, etc.) from .minecraft (but cannot download dependencies).
2. Add or edit a account (For online accounts, you have to enter your token and uuid manually).
3. Edit a game (you can adjust java path, window height/width, xms, xmx or enter the launch args manually). And separated versions are supported.

It seems there is something wrong with the UI of the artifacts uploaded below (Because they're build by GitHub Actions). Build one by yourself if you can.
